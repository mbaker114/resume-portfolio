            <p>Hello, my name is Michael Baker, as you can probably guess from the text at the top, and I am currently studying at McHenry County College with the hope of getting a degree in engineering. I spend most of my time studying for college, working at my job, spending time with my friends, and reading whenever I can get around to it. One thing that always gets me excited is technology and science; the whole idea of humanity getting better all the time makes me feel optimistic. Hopefully one day I can transfer to a four-year school and continue to pursue a science-related field.</p>
