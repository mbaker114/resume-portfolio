            <p>I would like to believe that taking this course helped me develop my skills. The fact that I find web development to be very fun, helps show me and makes me believe that this is something I can continue to work on outside of when the course concludes. I used to think I was a lousy programmer but working with HTML and CSS has helped a lot. this whole experience has given me confidence in my ability to learn a thing that I start unsure about.</p>
